        <h3>WELCOME TO THE SPECTROSCOPIC CENSUS IN THE SIGMA ORIONIS CLUSTER</h3>
        <p>

       This web page shows results of the spectroscopic survey of the young stellar population of the sigma Orionis cluster. Spectroscopic data for spectral typing come from several spectrograph with similar spectroscopic coverage and resolution: Hectospec (MMTO), FAST (FWLO), OSU-CCDS (MDMO), Boller & Chiven (SPMO) and Boller and Chiven (Observatorio Guillermo-Haro).  We use the SPTCLASS tool to obtain spectral types and to measure youth-related spectroscopic signatures. Members of the sigma Orionis cluster are confirmed by the presence of lithium in absorption, strong Halpha in emission or weak gravity-sensitive features. Additionally, we have obtained high resolution spectra (R~34000) for 169 stars which allow us to obtain membership by radial velocity and to study the relation between the infrared excesses and the Halpha profile of disk bearing stars. We compile information about members selected previously by the presence of lithium in absorption, radial velocity, X-ray sources above the zero age main sequence and infrared excess produced by circumstellar disks. Additional membership analysis includes variability, proper motion distribution, distance from the center of the cluster and photometric probability estimated using the V vs. V-J color magnitude diagram. This contribution constitutes the largest homogeneous spectroscopic data set of the sigma Orionis cluster. We expect to increase this spectroscopic database and the membership analisys for additional stars in the sigma Orionis cluster.
